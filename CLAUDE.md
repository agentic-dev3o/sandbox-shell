# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`sx` (sandbox-shell) is a Rust CLI that wraps shell sessions and commands in macOS Seatbelt sandboxes. It protects developers from malicious code in npm packages, untrusted repositories, and build scripts by restricting filesystem and network access.

## Programming Rules

Produce code following **LEAN, CLEAN, MINIMAL but thoughtful KISS & YAGNI principle**.
Follow TDD paradigm `red-green-refactor` for unit test.
Follow Rust Book, Rust API Guidelines, and idiomatic Rust resources.
